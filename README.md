	2.	Party Intelligence Component: Queries a proprietary API with host names and party addresses for additional insights.
	3.	Party Report Generation Component: Creates summary reports of party analysis results.
	4.	UI Component: Offers an intuitive interface for RSVPs, party hosting, and editing, with input fields, result displays, and admin tools for API management and settings.

Component Interaction:
	‚Ä¢	The UI communicates with the server for data exchange and report uploads.
	‚Ä¢	The server securely interacts with the database for data storage, retrieval, and deletion using authentication and hashing.

Design Rationale:
PartyHub integrates analysis tools for accurate party recommendations, leveraging diverse data sources like host and address histories. It ensures user-friendliness, security, and legal compliance, providing a reliable solution for enhancing social experiences while addressing dynamic networking challenges.
